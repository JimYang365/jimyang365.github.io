# The std::span as a view of an array

## Introduction

An instance of `std::span<T>` is a lightweight object that can refer to a contiguous sequence of objects starting at index zero. `std::span` is added to the standard library in C++20. However, it has been available to C++ developers as part of the [GSL](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL) for quite some time now.

Conceptually, a `span` is a non-owning view of an underlying sequence or array. Essentially, a `span` has two data members: a pointer and size. But, `span` is not just a plain struct. It also serves as an abstract sequential container by providing several standard container methods (e.g., begin, end, front, back), which makes it quite useful to work with the standard library.

Let's take an example. The function `add()` takes an `std::span<int>` and iterates over it to calculate the sum of elements, as shown:

```cpp
int64_t add(std::span<int> s) {
 int64_t sum = 0;
 for(auto i : s) //iterate over s
  sum += i;
 return sum;
}
```

If it weren't for the `span`, the `add()` would have to take pointer and length parameters, and we would not be able to use the range-based for loop. Also, the function's code is bound-safe.

`std::span` provides several constructors. But for the most part, it can be constructed with an array or explicitly with a combination of pointer and size. The `add()` can be called with different sequences as follows:

```cpp
/* An array. The size is implicit. */
int iArr[] = {1,1,1,1};
std::cout << add(iArr) << "\n"; //4

/* A dynamic array. 
   Requires explicit pointer and size to construct span. */
int* iPtr = new int[4];
iPtr[0] = iPtr[1] = iPtr[2] = iPtr[3] = 1;
std::cout << add({iPtr, 4}) << "\n"; //4

/* An std::array */
std::array<int, 4> isArr = {1,1,1,1};
std::cout << add(isArr) << "\n"; //4

/* A std::vector.
   Requires explicit pointer and size to construct span.*/
std::vector<int> iVec = {1,1,1,1};
std::cout << add({&iVec[0], 4}) << "\n"; //4
```

## The Question: A span on a section of an array

Consider a large `int` array, as shown below:

```cpp
int largeArr[100000];
```

We want to invoke `add()` only on a portion of this array: 100 elements from largeArr[400] to largeArr[499]. In real-life problems, this could be done to invoke a function in parallel (in multiple threads) on smaller pieces of an array to speed up processing.

Select below all the correct ways to invoke the `add()` on the 100 elements of the array, starting at index 400 (check Explanations for details):

```cpp
auto sum = add({largeArr+400, 100});

auto sum = add({&largeArr[400], 100});

auto sum = add(&largeArr[400]);

auto sum = add(std::span(&largeArr[400], 100));
```

## Finally

`std::span<T>` is a read-write view on a sequence or array. However, you can always create a read-only span by using `std::span<const T>`. A `span` can be used as a view on an `std::vector` (or a part of `std::vector`) too. But we cannot use `span` on `std::list` or `std::deque` because they are not contiguous containers.
